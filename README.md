## Thanks!

A big thanks to the owners of **mct.tantrum.org** who have tested nearly everything I have made and really given me direction and drive to make these things, this included risking having Simple Storage on their server despite the obvious fact that it was way too risky :D

Another big shoutout to **GentlemanCheesy** of **mc.talosmp.net** for being my first (and as of writing this, only!) sponsor. A few coffee's a month to make me feel better about making these addons <3
